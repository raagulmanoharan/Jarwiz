## Error Debugging Approach
When encountering errors, systematically solve them by:
1. Reading the full error message carefully
2. Identifying the root cause (e.g., JSX syntax requires .jsx extension)
3. Implementing the fix step by step
4. Testing to ensure the error is resolved

## Known Issues and Solutions
- **JSX Syntax Error**: When using JSX in Vite, files must have .jsx or .tsx extension
- **React Hook Errors**: TLdraw requires React setup, not just vanilla JavaScript
